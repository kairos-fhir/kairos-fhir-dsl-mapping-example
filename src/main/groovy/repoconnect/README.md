FHIR repository connect import mapping examples
======================

* This directory shows an example project with a set of groovy mappings, which can be used to connect an external FHIR store to a CentraXX system with
  a project specific FHIR profiling.
* It targets a common source profiling and results in CentraXX profiling: https://simplifier.net/centraxx-structures/
* The examples can be used as starting point. Feel free to extend scripts or combine examples for new projects.
* We love to receive feedback in the form of E-Mails, GitHub issues or pull requests.

# General ideas

* In CXX the user selects always a single patient from the repository connect FHIR search result to be staged, merged and imported to CentraXX.
  Therefore, all bundle sources should contain only one source patient resource.
* It is possible to transform multiple resources together, but it should result in exactly one patient bundle entry.
* All other resources of all bundles of all scripts will be stored to the first patient. Other patients are ignored.
* It is possible to transform all target resources in one or multiple scripts. Here we show a multi-script solution for more overview.
* Because the repository connect search will load only related resources to the selected patient, during transformation it is unnecessary for default to
  filter related data by subject again or specify a subject reference. It is not intended to move data between patients during transformation.
