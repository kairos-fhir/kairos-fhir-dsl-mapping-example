Example project for the Kairos FHIR DSL
========================================

This project contains Groovy example scripts for the use of the HDRP FHIR custom export interface. The examples show the possibilities how to
export HDRP data to FHIR in accordance to almost any FHIR R4 profile. More infos about HDRP can be found on
the [HDRP website](https://www.iqvia.com/locations/emea/iqvia-connected-healthcare-platform/iqvia-health-data-research-platform)

# Getting Started

A [brief tutorial](gettingstarted.md) on how to set up and configure the FHIR custom export in HDRP..

# How-To

- [Documentation for the HDRP setup of the FHIR Custom Export](docs/FHIR-Custom-Export-HDRP-Setup.md)
- [Documentation for the HDRP FHIR Bulk Data Export](docs/Bulk-Data-Export.md)
- [HDRP FHIR-DSL Tutorial](docs/FHIR-DSL-Tutorial.md)

# Requirements

* To write or modify custom export scripts, it is necessary to have a very good understanding of the source and target data models to transform into
  each other. Therefore, it is very helpful to use the kairos-fhir-dsl library as a dependency, which contains a HDRP JPA meta model as a source,
  and the FHIR R4 model as a target.
* This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for build management to download all necessary dependencies
  from [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central) or the kairos-fhir-dsl library
  from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/kairos-fhir/kairos-fhir-dsl-mapping-example/packages/606516/versions).

# GitHub Authentication with Maven

* Because GitHub does not allow downloading packages without access token, use maven with the access token in the local [settings.xml](settings.xml)
  in this project.

  ```
  mvn install -s settings.xml
  ```

* IntelliJ user can override the user settings file by File -> Settings -> Build Tools -> Maven or create own Maven run configurations. It is also
  possible to add it to .mvn/maven.config or to copy and past the repository authentication to another existing settings.file

* The kairos-fhir-dsl binaries before v.1.5.0 have not been published on a public maven repository yet, but can be downloaded in
  the [assets section of the corresponding tag](https://github.com/kairos-fhir/kairos-fhir-dsl-mapping-example/releases)
  and [installed manually](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html).

# Versioning

* The versioning of this example projects will be parallel to the kairos-fhir-dsl library, which
  follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
* All Groovy example scripts will contain a @since annotation that describes the first HDRP version, that can interpret the respective script. The
  specified HDRP version contains the necessary minimal version of the kairos-fhir-dsl library, HDRP entity exporter, initializer and support for
  the ExportResourceMappingConfig.json.
* The master branch might contain scripts, which using methods of the SNAPSHOT version of the underlying KAIROS-FHIR-DSL that has not been released
  yet. Please use only scripts of release tags, intended for your installed HDRP version.

# Contribution / Participation

* Everyone can fork the project.
* If you want to enrich the project with your own scripts, follow these steps:
    * Fork the project.
    * Create a new directory on your fork under src/main/groovy/projects
    * Add your new scripts.
    * Add a meaningful README.md file describing the purpose, sources, participants and HDRP version.
    * Create a pull request with your changes against our master branch.
    * If possible, please follow the existing basic coding standards:
        * use 2 spaces for indent / tab size
        * use final keyword wherever possible
        * prefer explicit typization instead of the untyped def keyword
* If you discover errors or bugs in existing scripts, we would be happy to receiving a notices in the form of e-mails, issues or pull requests.
